                                        <h4>Ever since I joined the Middle Georgia Regional Library system, I wanted to
                                            create a new ticketing system for staff to use. Google Forms (as a ticketing
                                            system) was lacking a
                                            lot of useful features that would allow us to do our jobs more efficiently.
                                            When using Forms, help desk agents are not able to directly respond to
                                            tickets, correspond with other agents about tickets, receive notifications,
                                            produce statistics, mark tickets resolved... and so on. The end-user is not
                                            allowed to check the status of their ticket or add an attachment without
                                            contacting one of us
                                            directly. Also, I noticed that my department was spending a considerable
                                            amount of time communicating information <i>about</i> the tickets before we
                                            had even begun the process of solving them. Questions such as: <i>Have you
                                                seen that ticket from John yet?</i>, <i>Did you ever get a

                                            repeated enough times throughout the week that I knew a better, more
                                            centralized ticketing
                                            solution had to be out there for us.<br><br>

                                            I started to research our options and found many cloud
                                            providers could get us going in no time, but I was hesitant to pursue
                                            any of those because they were not free. It would not fare well for my
                                            pitch if I was adding a new recurring cost to our department when Google
                                            Forms is free and already gets the job done, even if it isn't built to be a
                                            ticketing system. Coincidentally, around that same time, my boss told me
                                            that there was a server machine (a Dell PowerEdge T110 II) from the past
                                            administration that she had no use for, and I could tinker with it if I
                                            wanted to. Because I wanted a free option and had a server machine
                                            available, I
                                            settled on the fact that I was going to host my own ticketing system at the
                                            library using this machine.<br><br>

                                            After coming to this realization, my research became very easy because I
                                            knew exactly what I wanted: something <b>free</b> and open-source, capable
                                            being hosted locally, and packed with all the features missing from Google
                                            Forms. Welcome: <a href="https://osticket.com/"
                                                target="_blank">osTicket</a>. osTicket is not only free <i>and</i>
                                            self-hostable, it provides support agents with a
                                            centralized communication platform and enables end-users to input tickets
                                            and check on the status of tickets via the web, integrates with email,
                                            allows
                                            attachments, and many other features that "just make sense" for a ticketing
                                            system to have.

                                            <br><br>I decided to install Ubuntu Server on the machine to host it because
                                            it is also free, open-source, lightweight, has a huge community to provide
                                            support, and within my realm of experience. I could have used the Windows
                                            Server 2016 partition on the machine, but I felt that using IIS would be
                                            overkill in
                                            this case.<br><br>

                                            I began by installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu Server and then installing
                                            &amp;
                                            configuring Apache2. This process took a considerable amount of time because
                                            I
                                            had never used Apache to host websites in the past, so it took me some time
                                            to figure out the syntax of the config files. But, after Apache was
                                            configured correctly I could access the webserver from the
                                            machine’s browser by typing localhost in my browser's URL bar. To ensure
                                            that the webserver was accessible from outside the current network, I placed
                                            a ticket
                                            with Windstream to open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on the library's
                                            router. While
                                            waiting on that to be resolved, I installed and configured a local MySQL
                                            Server and installed PHP. osTicket took me through the rest of the setup
                                            process of installing dependencies and tying everything together. The web
                                            server was up and running with a fresh copy of osTicket! Now to configure
                                            the server. Customizing each page, adding help topics and departments,
                                            adding email configuration, tweaking other settings did take some time. You

                                            process in the osTicket <a

                                            <br><br>
                                            I then gave the public IP of the server machine to <a
                                                href="https://www.usg.edu/" target="_blank">The University System of
                                                Georgia</a> (who manages our bibblib.org
                                            domain) so they could set up an A record for a new subdomain using this IP
                                            address. The
                                            purpose of this was to ensure that the server could be accessed from the
                                            Internet using the URL <a href="https://help.bibblib.org"
                                                target="_blank">help.bibblib.org</a>.<br><br>
                                            So, the webserver is up, it’s accessible from the Internet using a public
                                            domain. Great! About half of the project is complete at this point. I then
                                            trained my
                                            supervisor on how to manage, maintain,
                                            conduct backups, and any other pertinent information about the server. Also,
                                            <b>this is a machine that is publicly accessible from the Internet</b> so
                                            protecting it (and the rest of our network) was a must. I followed an Apache
                                            server hardening guide, installed <a
                                                href="https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"
                                                target="_blank">Fail2ban</a>, and made sure HTTPS was strictly enforced.
                                            <br><br>Finally, I needed to migrate everyone over to the new system. I was
                                            able to export staff names and emails to a CSV file from my Google Admin
                                            dashboard. osTicket conveniently supports CSV import, so all the staff was
                                            moved over in a matter of minutes. Everyone logs in with their work email
                                            and sets their own password. Of course, these passwords are hashed and not
                                            visible to anyone, including myself.<br><br>
                                            <span class="custom_heading">Conclusion</span>
                                            The project as a whole took a few months to complete. After all, it was
                                            never formally assigned to me. It was a product of my initiative that I
                                            would work on when I had a break from my usual duties. It was incredibly
                                            worth the wait, however. I was able to provide a tremendous service to MGRL
                                            who
                                            will benefit from this ticketing system for years to come. I can also say
                                            that I personally benefitted from this project because I received so much
                                            learning and practice about serving webpages using Apache, SSL certificate
                                            authorities, server hardening, MySQL databases, and Linux.<br><br>I have

                                            received so many compliments from staff who find the new ticketing system
                                            easier and all-around better to use. It has provided my department with
                                            the centralized communication we needed on top of many quality-of-life
                                            improvements that we were not getting from Google
                                            Forms. It has been working correctly with no intervention for over one
                                            hundred days now, so I would consider this project a great success!
